 Github - Step by step:
 1. Create branches from MAIN branch
 2. Create branches for each new feature
 3. Naming convention: prefix - "Feature/-" whatever
 4. Merge MAIN branch into FEATURE branch to handle potential conflicts

Guidelines:
1. Make sure to use a consistent folder structure for your Unity project, so that it's easy for other developers to find the assets they need.

2. Make sure to commit and push your changes often, especially when you're working on a new feature or making significant changes to the code.

3. When making changes to the code, create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix, and make sure to include clear and descriptive commit messages.

4. Use pull requests to review and merge changes into the main branch. Make sure to communicate with other developers and respond to feedback in a timely manner.
